A few things to know before you create an issue

* This package requires [Atom 1.21 beta](https://atom.io/beta)
* We launch a "language server" process on your machine that understands the language you are editing
* What that server can do - syntax compatibility, whether it supports formatting or outlines etc - is outside of our control
* You can see what the language server supports by checking out our README and following the link after "powered by"
* "disconnected", "JSONRPC" or "Content-Header" errors indicate that server process died. We're working on better recovery right now

If you have understood all this, please remove this text and start writing your issue :)
